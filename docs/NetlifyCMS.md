# NetlifyCMS integration

This theme has been adapted to work well with the netlifycms open source project.

## Known issues

- Pages failing to load from local browser storage on reload. (issue has been opened)
- Media uploads are directly commited to the develop branch without being added to the corresponding pull-request
  - This means that a staging.l.o build occurs from just uploading an image.
