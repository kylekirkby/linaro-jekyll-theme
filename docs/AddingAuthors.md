# Adding Authors

Authors are added to a `_authors` collection in order to easily generate pages for each author. You can also access the blog authors through `site.authors` when using a Jekyll collection.

The following is an example author collection object (\_authors/kyle.md):

```yaml
---
name: Kyle Kirkby # Required: full name of the author
username: kyle # Required: The username you will add to your posts
twitter: https://twitter.com # Optional
github: https://github.com/kylekirkby # Optional
linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylekirkby/ # Optional
youtube: https://youtube.com # Optional
image: /assets/images/kyle.jpg # Optional: optional author image but recommended.
---
Your author image bio in **markdown** goes here.
```
