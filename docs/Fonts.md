## Fontello for icons

Fontello is great for creating slim icon fonts from popular font collections. `/assets/fonts/fontello/` contains the Fontello icons fonts in various formats. The `_sass/core/fontello.scss` file is a modified version of the generated css provided by Fontello.

### Adding more Fontello icons

You can easily add more icons to your Fontello font by importing the /assets/fonts/fontello/fontello.svg file into [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) by clicking the `Spanner Icon` and then `Import`. Your icons are then shown in the `Custom Icons` section below. Here you can select the imported fonts to be included in your new font. Then click the download button and place the generated font files in `/assets/fonts/fontello/`. Finally, override the `_sass/core/fontello.scss` file with your updated `fontello.css` styles (make sure the paths for import the library are correct).

## Lato

Lato is the font that this theme ships with but you can easily swap out Lato for another font.
